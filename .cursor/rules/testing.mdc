# Test Assertions

- When testing functions that return objects, define a single `expected` object and use one `assertEquals(expected, result)` rather than multiple property-level assertions.
- This leverages data class equality and provides clearer test failure messages.

Example:
```kotlin
@Test
fun fromResponse_mapsFields() {
    val response = SomeResponse(...)

    val result = SomeMapper.fromResponse(response)
    
    val expected = SomeResult(
        field1 = "value1",
        field2 = "value2",
    )
    assertEquals(expected, result)
}
```
